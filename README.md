# ApiMaker

Generates Rails API endpoints and JavaScript API files for Webpack and more by inspecting your models and serializers.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "api_maker"
```

ApiMaker requires [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker), so make sure you have that set up as well. It also uses an extension called [qs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs), that you should add to your packages, but that is probally already there by default.

ApiMaker makes use of [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) to keep track of what models a given user should have access to. Make a file where you define access in `app/models/api_maker_ability.rb` containing something like this:
```ruby
class ApiMakerAbility
  include CanCan::Ability

  def initialize(args:)
    user = args.fetch(:current_user)

    if user
      can :manage, Project, user_id: user.id
      can :manage, Task, project: {user_id: user.id}
      can :manage, User, id: user.id
    end
  end
end
```

Add an `api_maker_args` method to your application controller. This controls what arguments will be passed to the CanCan ability and the serializers:
```ruby
class ApplicationController
private

  def api_maker_args
    {current_user: current_user}
  end
end
```

ApiMaker will only create models, endpoints and serializers for ActiveRecord models that are defined as resources. So be sure to add resources under `app/api_maker/resources` for your models first.
```ruby
class Resources::ApplicationResource < ApiMaker::BaseResource
end
```

```ruby
class Resources::UserResources < Resources::ApplicationResource
  attributes :id, :email, :custom_attribute
  collection_commands :count_users
  member_commands :calculate_age
  relationships :account, :tasks

  def custom_attribute
    "Hello world! Current user is: #{args.fetch(:current_user).email}"
  end
end
```

ApiMaker uses that to keep track of what attributes, relationships and commands you want exposed through the API.

Its now time to generate everything like this:
```bash
rake api_maker:generate_models
```

If you want to be able to create and update models, then you should go into each generated controller and create a params method to define, which attributes can be written on each model like this:
```ruby
class ApiMaker::ProjectsController < ApiMaker::ModelController
private

  def project_params
    params.require(:project).permit(:name)
  end
end
```

## Usage

### Creating a new model from JavaScript

```js
import Task from "ApiMaker/Models/Task"

var task = new Task()
task.assignAttributes({name: "New task"})
task.create().then((status) => {
  if (status.success) {
    console.log("Task was created with ID: " + task.id())
  } else {
    console.log("Task wasnt created")
  }
})
```

### Finding an existing model

```js
Task.find(5).then((task) => {
  console.log("Task found: " + task.name())
})
```

### Updating a model

```js
task.assignAttributes({name: "New name"})
task.save().then((status) => {
  if (status.success) {
    console.log("Task was updated and name is now: " + task.name())
  } else {
    console.log("Task wasnt updated")
  }
})
```

```js
task.update({name: "New name"}).then((status) => {
  if (status.success) {
    console.log("Task was updated and name is now: " + task.name())
  } else {
    console.log("Task wasnt updated")
  }
})
```

### Deleting a model

```js
task.destroy().then((status) => {
  if (status.success) {
    console.log("Task was destroyed")
  } else {
    console.log("Task wasnt destroyed")
  }
})
```

### Query models

ApiModels uses [Ransack](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack) to expose a huge amount of options to query data.

```js
Task.ransack({name_cont: "something"}).toArray().then((tasks) => {
  console.log("Found: " + tasks.length + " tasks")
})
```

### Sorting models

```js
Task.ransack({s: "id desc"})
```

### Attributes

Each attribute is defined as a method on each model. So if you have an attribute called `name` on the `Task`-model, then it be read by doing this: `task.name()`.

### Relationships

#### Has many

A `has many` relationship will return a collection the queries the sub models.

```js
project.tasks().toArray().then((tasks) => {
  console.log("Project " + project.id() + " has " + tasks.length + " tasks")

  for(var key in tasks) {
    var task = tasks[key]
    console.log("Task " + task.id() + " is named: " + task.name())
  }
})
```

#### Belongs to

A `belongs to` relationship will return a promise that will get that model:

```js
task.project().then((project) => {
  console.log("Task " + task.id() + " belongs to a project called: " + project.name())
})
```

#### Has one

A `has one` relationship will also return a promise that will get that model like a `belongs to` relationship.

#### Getting the current user

First include this in your layout, so JS can know which user is signed in:
```erb
<body>
  <%= render "/api_maker/data" %>
```

Then you can do like this in JS:
```js
import Devise from "ApiMaker/Devise"

Devise.currentUser().then((user) => {
  console.log("The current user has this email: " + user.email())
})
```
