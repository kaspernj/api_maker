Fork the [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/necolas/react-native-web/tree/master/packages/react-native-web-examples) to make changes and see the results.\n\nYou'll notice that there is no reference to `react-dom` in components. The `App` component that is shown below is defined using the APIs and Components of React Native, but it can also be rendered on the web using React Native for Web.\n\n```js\n// Example component\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry, StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.box}>\n        <Text style={styles.text}>Hello, world!</Text>\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  box: { padding: 10 },\n  text: { fontWeight: 'bold' }\n});\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('App', () => App);\nAppRegistry.runApplication('App', { rootTag: document.getElementById('react-root') });\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nDevelopment happens in the open on GitHub and we are grateful for contributions including bugfixes, improvements, and ideas. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving React Native for Web.\n\n### Code of conduct\n\nThis project expects all participants to adhere to Meta's OSS [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]. Please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.\n\n### Contributing guide\n\nRead the [contributing guide][contributing-url] to learn about the development process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes to React Native for Web.\n\n### Good first issues\n\nTo help you get you familiar with the contribution process, there is a list of [good first issues][good-first-issue-url] that contain bugs which have a relatively limited scope. This is a great place to get started.\n\n## License\n\nReact Native for Web is [MIT licensed](./LICENSE).
