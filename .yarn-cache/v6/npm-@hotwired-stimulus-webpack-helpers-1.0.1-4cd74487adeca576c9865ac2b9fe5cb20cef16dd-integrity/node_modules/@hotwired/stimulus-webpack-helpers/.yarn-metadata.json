Then, pass the resulting context to the `Application#load` method using the `definitionsFromContext` helper:\n\n```js\n// src/application.js\nimport { Application } from \"@hotwired/stimulus\"\nimport { definitionsFromContext } from \"@hotwired/stimulus-webpack-helpers\"\n\nwindow.Stimulus = Application.start()\nconst context = require.context(\"./controllers\", true, /\\.js$/)\nStimulus.load(definitionsFromContext(context))\n```\n\n## Getting Help & Contributing Back\n\nLooking for the docs? Once you've read through the Handbook, consult the [Stimulus Reference](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/reference/controllers) for API details.\n\nHave a question about Stimulus? Connect with other Stimulus developers on the [Hotwire Discourse](https://discuss.hotwired.dev/) community forum.\n\nFind a bug? Head over to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/hotwired/stimulus-webpack-helpers/issues) and we'll do our best to help. We love pull requests, too!\n\nWe expect all Stimulus contributors to abide by the terms of our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nStimulus is [MIT-licensed](LICENSE.md) open-source software from [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), the creators of [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).\n\nContinuous integration VMs generously provided by [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/open-source).\n\n---\n\n© 2021 Basecamp, LLC.\n",
