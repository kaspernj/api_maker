    "readme": "# debounce\n\n> Delay function calls until a set time elapses after the last invocation\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install debounce\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nimport debounce from 'debounce';\n\nfunction resize() {\n\tconsole.log('height', window.innerHeight);\n\tconsole.log('width', window.innerWidth);\n}\n\nwindow.onresize = debounce(resize, 200);\n```\n\nTo check if the debounce delay is currently active:\n\n```js\nwindow.onresize.isPending;\n```\n\nTo later clear the timer and cancel currently scheduled executions:\n\n```js\nwindow.onresize.clear();\n```\n\nExecute immediately only if a call is pending (and reset the timer):\n\n```js\nwindow.onresize.flush();\n```\n\nTo execute immediately and reset the timer if it was previously set:\n\n```js\nwindow.onresize.trigger();\n```\n\n## API\n\n### debounce(fn, wait, options?)\n\nCreates a debounced function that delays execution until `wait` milliseconds have passed since its last invocation.\n\nSet the `immediate` option to `true` to execute the function immediately at the start of the `wait` interval, preventing issues such as double-clicks on a button.\n\nThe returned function has the following methods:\n\n- `.isPending` indicates whether the debounce delay is currently active.\n- `.clear()` cancels any scheduled executions.\n- `.flush()` if an execution is scheduled then it will be immediately executed and the timer will be cleared.\n- `.trigger()` executes the function immediately and clears the timer if it was previously set.\n\n## Related\n\n- [p-debounce](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-debounce) - Similar but handles promises\n- [throttleit](https://github.com/sindresorhus/throttleit) - Throttle a function to limit its execution rate\n",
