It doesn't seek to take over your entire front-end—in fact, it's not concerned with rendering HTML at all. Instead, it's designed to augment your HTML with just enough behavior to make it shine. Stimulus pairs beautifully with [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev) to provide a complete solution for fast, compelling applications with a minimal amount of effort.\n\nHow does it work? Sprinkle your HTML with controller, target, and action attributes:\n\n```html\n<div data-controller=\"hello\">\n  <input data-hello-target=\"name\" type=\"text\">\n\n  <button data-action=\"click->hello#greet\">Greet</button>\n\n  <span data-hello-target=\"output\"></span>\n</div>\n```\n\nThen write a compatible controller. Stimulus brings it to life automatically:\n\n```js\n// hello_controller.js\nimport { Controller } from \"@hotwired/stimulus\"\n\nexport default class extends Controller {\n  static targets = [ \"name\", \"output\" ]\n\n  greet() {\n    this.outputTarget.textContent =\n      `Hello, ${this.nameTarget.value}!`\n  }\n}\n```\n\nStimulus continuously watches the page, kicking in as soon as attributes appear or disappear. It works with any update to the DOM, regardless of whether it comes from a full page load, a [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev) page change, or an Ajax request. Stimulus manages the whole lifecycle.\n\nYou can write your first controller in five minutes by following along in the [Stimulus Handbook](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/handbook/introduction).\n\nYou can read more about why we created this new framework in [The Origin of Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/handbook/origin).\n\n## Installing Stimulus\n\nYou can use Stimulus with any asset packaging systems. And if you prefer no build step at all, just drop a `<script>` tag on the page and get right down to business.\n\nSee the [Installation Guide](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/handbook/installing) for detailed instructions.\n\n## Getting Help\n\nLooking for the docs? Once you've read through the Handbook, consult the [Stimulus Reference](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/reference/controllers) for API details.\n\nHave a question about Stimulus? Connect with other Stimulus developers on the [Hotwire Discourse](https://discuss.hotwired.dev/) community forum.\n\n## Contributing Back\n\nFind a bug?

We love pull requests, too!\n\nWe expect all Stimulus contributors to abide by the terms of our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n### Development\n\n- Fork the project locally\n- `yarn install`\n- `yarn start` - to run the local dev server with examples\n- `yarn test` - to run the unit tests\n- `yarn lint` - to run the linter with ESLint\n- `yarn format` - to format changes with Prettier\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nStimulus is [MIT-licensed](LICENSE.md) open-source software from [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), the creators of [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org).\n\nContinuous integration VMs generously provided by [Sauce Labs](https://opensource.saucelabs.com/).\n\n---\n\n© 2023 Basecamp, LLC.\n",
