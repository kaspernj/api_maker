[ASN1js] is a pure JavaScript library implementing this standard.  ASN.1 is the basis of all X.509 related data structures and numerous other protocols used on the web.\n\n## Important Information for ASN1.js V1 Users\nASN1.js V2 (ES2015 version) is **incompatible** with ASN1.js V1 code.\n\n## Introduction\n\n[ASN1js] is the first library for [BER] encoding/decoding in Javascript designed for browser use. [BER] is the basic encoding rules for [ASN.1] that all others are based on, [DER] is the encoding rules used by PKI applications - it is a subset of [BER]. The [ASN1js] library was tested against [freely available ASN.1:2008 test suite], with some limitations related to JavaScript language. \n\n## Features of the library\n\n* Based on latest features of JavaScript language from ES2015 standard;\n* [ASN1js] is a \"base layer\" for full-featured JS library [PKIjs], which is using Web Cryptography API and has all classes, necessary to work with PKI-related data;\n* Fully object-oriented library. Inheritance is using everywhere inside the lib;\n* Working with HTML5 data objects (ArrayBuffer, Uint8Array etc.);\n* Working with all ASN.1:2008 types;\n* Working with [BER] encoded data;\n* All types inside the library constantly stores information about all ASN.1 sub blocks (tag block, length block or value block);\n* User may have access to any byte inside any ASN.1 sub-block;\n* Any sub-block may have unlimited length, as it described in ASN.1 standard (even \"tag block\");\n* Ability to work with ASN.1 string date types (including all \"international\" strings like UniversalString, BMPString, UTF8String) by passing native JavaScript strings into constructors. And vice versa - all initially parsed data of ASN.1 string types right after decoding automatically converts into native JavaScript strings;\n* Same with ASN.1 date-time types: for major types like UTCTime and GeneralizedTime there are automatic conversion between \"JS date type - ASN.1 date-time type\" + vice versa;\n* Same with ASN.1 OBJECT-IDENTIFIER (OID) data-type: you can initialize OID by JavaScript string and can get string representation via calling \"oid.valueBlock.toString()\";\n* Working with \"easy-to-understand\" ASN.1 schemas (pre-defined or built by user);\n* Has special types to work with ASN.1 schemas:\n  * Any\n  * Choice\n  * Repeated \n* User can name any block inside ASN.1 schema and easily get information by name;\n* Ability to parse internal data inside a primitively encoded data types and automatically validate it against special schema;\n* All types inside library are dynamic;\n* All types can be initialized in static or dynamic ways.\n* [ASN1js] fully tested against [ASN.1:2008 TestSuite].\n\n## Examples\n\n### How to create new ASN. structures\n```javascript\nvar sequence = new asn1js.Sequence();\nsequence.valueBlock.value.push(new asn1js.Integer({ value: 1 }));\n\nvar sequence_buffer = sequence.toBER(false); // Encode current sequence to BER (in ArrayBuffer)\nvar current_size = sequence_buffer.byteLength;\n\nvar integer_data = new ArrayBuffer(8);\nvar integer_view = new Uint8Array(integer_data);\ninteger_view[0] = 0x01;\ninteger_view[1] = 0x01;\ninteger_view[2] = 0x01;\ninteger_view[3] = 0x01;\ninteger_view[4] = 0x01;\ninteger_view[5] = 0x01;\ninteger_view[6] = 0x01;\ninteger_view[7] = 0x01;\n\nsequence.valueBlock.value.push(new asn1js.Integer({\n  isHexOnly: true,\n  valueHex: integer_data,\n})); // Put too long for decoding Integer value\n\nsequence_buffer = sequence.toBER();\ncurrent_size = sequence_buffer.byteLength;\n```\n\n### How to create new ASN.1 structures by calling constructors with parameters\n```javascript\nvar sequence2 = new asn1js.Sequence({\n  value: [\n    new asn1js.Integer({ value: 1 }),\n    new asn1js.Integer({\n      isHexOnly: true,\n      valueHex: integer_data\n    }),\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n### How to validate ASN.1 against pre-defined schema \n```javascript\nvar asn1_schema = new asn1js.Sequence({\n  name: \"block1\",\n  value: [\n    new asn1js.Null({\n      name: \"block2\"\n    }),\n    new asn1js.Integer({\n      name: \"block3\",\n      optional: true // This block is absent inside data, but it's \"optional\". Hence verification against the schema will be passed.\n    })\n  ]\n});\n\nvar variant1 = asn1js.verifySchema(encoded_sequence, asn1_schema); // Verify schema together with decoding of raw data\nvar variant1_verified = variant1.verified;\nvar variant1_result = variant1.result; // Verified decoded data with all block names inside\n```\n\n### How to use \"internal schemas\" for primitively encoded data types\n```javascript \nvar primitive_octetstring = new asn1js.OctetString({ valueHex: encoded_sequence }); // Create a primitively encoded OctetString where internal data is an encoded Sequence\n\nvar asn1_schema_internal = new asn1js.OctetString({\n  name: \"outer_block\",\n  primitiveSchema: new asn1js.Sequence({\n    name: \"block1\",\n    value: [\n      new asn1js.Null({\n        name: \"block2\"\n      })\n    ]\n  })\n});\n\nvar variant6 = asn1js.compareSchema(primitive_octetstring, primitive_octetstring, asn1_schema_internal);\nvar variant6_verified = variant4.verified;\nvar variant6_block1_tag_num = variant6.result.block1.idBlock.tagNumber;\nvar variant6_block2_tag_num = variant6.result.block2.idBlock.tagNumber;\n```\n\nMore examples could be found in \"examples\" directory or inside [PKIjs] library.\n\n## Related source code \n\n* [C++ ASN1:2008 BER coder/decoder](https://github.com/YuryStrozhevsky/C-plus-plus-ASN.1-2008-coder-decoder) - the \"father\" of [ASN1js] project;\n* [Freely available ASN.1:2008 test suite](https://github.com/YuryStrozhevsky/ASN1-2008-free-test-suite) - the suite which can help you to validate (and better understand) any ASN.1 coder/decoder;\n* [NPM package for ASN.1:2008 test suite](https://github.com/YuryStrozhevsky/asn1-test-suite)\n\n## Suitability\nThere are several commercial products, enterprise solutions as well as open source project based on versions of ASN1js. You should, however, do your own code and security review before utilization in a production application before utilizing any open source library to ensure it will meet your needs.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2014, [GMO GlobalSign](http://www.globalsign.com/)\nCopyright (c) 2015-2022, [Peculiar Ventures](http://peculiarventures.com/)\nAll rights reserved.\n\nAuthor 2014-2018, [Yury Strozhevsky](http://www.strozhevsky.com/).\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, \nare permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.
