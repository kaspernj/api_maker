    "description": "Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the basis of how identity and key management is performed on the web today. PKIjs is a pure JavaScript library implementing the formats that are used in PKI applications. It is built on WebCrypto and aspires to make it possible to build native web applications that utilize X.509 and the related formats on the web without plug-ins",

It enables the requestor to prove control of a given public key.\n- Cryptographic Message Syntax (RFC 5652) is the most commonly used data structure for signing data in X.509 applications. CMS makes it easy to both sign and represent all of the data needed to verify a signature.\n- Cryptographic Message Syntax (RFC 5652) is also the most commonly used data structure for encrypting data in X.509 applications. CMS makes it easy to provide interoperable data encryption.\n- Time-Stamp Protocol (RFC 3161) is the most commonly used protocol for proving that data\nexisted before a particular time. It is commonly used in signing applications to ensure signatures are verifiable long into the future.\n\n## Objectives\n- Typescript and object-oriented implementation\n- Contains no cryptographic implementations and instead leverages Web Crypto API\n- Work uniformly both in browser and in [Node](https://nodejs.org/)/[Deno](https://deno.com/)\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the stable version:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save pkijs\n```\n\nThis assumes you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as your package manager.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n### Certificates and Revocation\n\n- [Create and validate an X.509 certificate](https://pkijs.org/docs/examples/certificates-and-revocation/create-and-validate-certificate)\n- [Working with certificate requests](https://pkijs.org/docs/examples/certificates-and-revocation/working-with-certificate-requests)\n- [Creating and parsing CRLs](https://pkijs.org/docs/examples/certificates-and-revocation/creating-and-parsing-CRLs)\n- [Working with OCSP requests](https://pkijs.org/docs/examples/certificates-and-revocation/working-with-OCSP-requests)\n- [Working with OCSP responses](https://pkijs.org/docs/examples/certificates-and-revocation/working-with-OCSP-responses)\n\n### Signing and Encryption with CMS\n\n- [Working with CMS Signing](https://pkijs.org/docs/examples/signing-and-encryption-with-CMS/working-with-CMS-signing)\n- [Working with CMS Certificate-based Encryption](https://pkijs.org/docs/examples/signing-and-encryption-with-CMS/working-with-CMS-certificate-based-encryption)\n- [Working with CMS password-based Encryption](https://pkijs.org/docs/examples/signing-and-encryption-with-CMS/working-with-CMS-password-based-encryption)\n- [Working with PKCS#7 Certificate bags (P7B)](https://pkijs.org/docs/examples/signing-and-encryption-with-CMS/working-with-PKCS-7-certificate-bags-P7B)\n\n### Timestamping\n- [Creating a Timestamp request](https://pkijs.org/docs/examples/timestamping/creating-a-timestamp-request)\n- [Creating a Timestamp response](https://pkijs.org/docs/examples/timestamping/creating-a-timestamp-response)\n\n### Other\n- [How to verify a signature in a PDF file](https://pkijs.org/docs/examples/other/how-to-verify-a-signature-in-a-PDF-file)\n- [S/MIME signature verification](https://pkijs.org/docs/examples/other/S-MIME-signature-verification)\n- [S/MIME signature encryption](https://pkijs.org/docs/examples/other/S-MIME-signature-encryption)\n- [Working with PKCS#12 files](https://pkijs.org/docs/examples/other/working-with-PKCS-12-files)\n\n## Documentation\nYou can find the PKI.js documentation [on the website](https://pkijs.org/docs/installation).\n\n## Want to help?\nWant to file a bug, contribute some code, or improve documentation?
